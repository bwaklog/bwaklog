Hey visitors!

Let me introduce myself. I go by the name Aditya Hegde. I use the online name of *bwaklog* or *hedgae*.I am an 18 year old student based in Bengaluru, India. Currently pursuing in B.Tech. This is my github page, which i mostly use for saving some small scale projects. Look forward towards building useful products and collaborating in open source. 

I'm not an experienced developer in any shape or form. I consider myself as a novice. I code to satisfy my own expectations and demands, and learn simultaneously. Currently focusing on Python, C, C++, html, css and javascript. 

If you are interested for some apparent reason, i'd like to introduce the other side of mine. Besides studying in Engineering field, I have a passion for music, and play the guitar. All those aside, I love photography. Just some thing I love doing besides learning and developing in front of a screen.
