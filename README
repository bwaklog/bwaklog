    🏫 Currently pursuing my bachelors degree in CSE at PES Uni.

    of both the Mentoring and Design team.

    I'm really interested in working with system level, databases,
    networking concepts and growing fondly of quantum physics. 
    Currently reasearching on Databases and Distributed Systems. 
    Working on the `MIT 6.5640 lab` for distributed systems.

    Working on a few projects in `go` and trying to get my way 
    around `rust`.
